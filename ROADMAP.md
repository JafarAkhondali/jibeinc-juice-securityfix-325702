## Roadmap
1. ~~Rewrite infinite scroll (we can't get to 100% code coverage until we can test infinite scroll)~~
1. ~~Strip deprecated components (State.js, URL.js, SentenceGenerator - already removed from JSM and JA)~~
1. ~~Draft GitHub release with Travis~~
1. Get 100% test coverage
1. Come up with a solution for browser vendor shimming ( Design patterns book: Addy Yosmani jQuery browser specific stuff) ~ make sure that the bind-click works for all browsers and environments.
Tests need to be spoofing each browserâ€™s implementation or firing the vendor-specific behaviors and account for them.
